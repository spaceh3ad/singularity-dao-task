# Fuzz Testing for ContractManager and MultisigContract

## Overview

This documentation covers the fuzz testing suite for the `ContractManager` and `MultisigContract`. The suite aims to validate the robust handling of a wide range of inputs for `ContractManager`'s functionalities and certain `MultisigContract` operations.

## Test Environment Setup

- Initializes a `MultisigContract` with a single owner (Bob) and sets the approval threshold to 1.
- Associates the `ContractManager` with the `MultisigContract` for direct interaction.

## Fuzz Tests

### Adding Contract Description

- **Purpose**: Verifies the ability of the multisig contract to add new contract descriptions.
- **Method**: `testFuzz_addContractDescription(uint160 _contract, string calldata _description)`
- **Parameters**:
  - `_contract`: A fuzzed contract address.
  - `_description`: The contract description to be added.
- **Assumptions**: The description string is not empty.
- **Execution**: Simulates the action as performed by the multisig contract itself.
- **Verification**: Checks that the added description matches the input.

### Updating Contract Description

- **Purpose**: Tests the update functionality for existing contract descriptions via the multisig contract.
- **Method**: `testFuzz_updateContractDescription(uint160 _contract, string calldata _description, string calldata _newDescription)`
- **Parameters**:
  - `_contract`: A fuzzed contract address.
  - `_description`: The initial description to add.
  - `_newDescription`: The new description to update the contract with.
- **Assumptions**: Both descriptions are non-empty and distinct.
- **Execution**: Adds a description and then updates it, all actions simulated as performed by the multisig.
- **Verification**: Ensures the final description matches the new input.

### Removing Contract Description

- **Purpose**: Validates the removal of contract descriptions through the multisig contract.
- **Method**: `testFuzz_removeContractDescription(uint160 _contract, string calldata _description)`
- **Parameters**:
  - `_contract`: A fuzzed contract address.
  - `_description`: The description to be removed.
- **Assumptions**: The description is not empty.
- **Execution**: Adds a description before removing it, simulated as performed by the multisig.
- **Verification**: Confirms the description has been successfully removed.

### Approving an Action

- **Purpose**: Ensures non-existent actions cannot be approved, testing the multisig's action approval validation.
- **Method**: `testFuzz_approveAction(uint256 _actionId)`
- **Parameters**:
  - `_actionId`: The ID of the action to approve.
- **Execution**: Attempts to approve an action with a random or fuzzed ID.
- **Verification**: Expects the operation to revert with an `ActionDoesNotExist` error.
