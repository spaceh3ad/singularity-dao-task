# Fuzz Testing for ContractManager

## Overview

The `ContractManagerFuzz` contract is designed to perform comprehensive fuzz testing on the `ContractManager` contract's functions. These tests ensure the contract's methods for adding, updating, and removing contract descriptions handle a wide range of inputs correctly, highlighting the robustness and security of the contract's functionality.

## Test Setup

- The testing environment is initialized by deploying the `ContractManager` contract and setting up addresses for the owner and a non-owner to simulate different permission levels.

## Fuzz Tests

### Adding Contract Description

- **Purpose**: Verifies that a contract description can be added successfully by the owner.
- **Method**: `testFuzz_addContractDescription(uint160 _contract, string calldata _description)`
- **Parameters**:
  - `_contract`: Fuzzed contract address for which the description is to be added.
  - `_description`: The contract description to add.
- **Assumptions**:
  - The description is not empty.
- **Expected Outcome**: The contract description is added, and its integrity is verified by comparing the stored description with the input.

### Updating Contract Description

- **Purpose**: Ensures that an existing contract description can be updated successfully by the owner.
- **Method**: `testFuzz_updateContractDescription(uint160 _contract, string calldata _description, string calldata _newDescription)`
- **Parameters**:
  - `_contract`: Fuzzed contract address whose description is to be updated.
  - `_description`: The initial description to add for the contract.
  - `_newDescription`: The new description to update the contract with.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Both descriptions are not empty, and the new description is different from the original.
- **Expected Outcome**: The contract description is updated, confirmed by matching the stored description with the new input.

### Removing Contract Description

- **Purpose**: Tests that a contract description can be removed successfully by the owner.
- **Method**: `testFuzz_removeContractDescription(uint160 _contract, string calldata _description)`
- **Parameters**:
  - `_contract`: Fuzzed contract address from which the description is to be removed.
  - `_description`: The description to add and then remove for the contract.
- **Assumptions**:
  - The description is not empty.
- **Expected Outcome**: The contract description is removed, evidenced by an empty string in place of the previously stored description.
