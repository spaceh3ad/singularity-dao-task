# Integraion Tests for ContractManager and MultisigContract

The following tests are designed to ensure that the `ContractManager` and `MultisigContract` work together correctly, particularly focusing on the multisig functionality's ability to manage contract descriptions securely and efficiently.

## Test Environment Setup

The test suite initializes a `MultisigContract` with four owners (Alice, Bob, Eve, and John) with a requirement of three approvals for an action to be executed. The `ContractManager` instance is accessed through the `MultisigContract`.

## Test Cases

### Adding Contract Description via Multisig

- **`test_addContractDescription`**: Proposes and approves an action to add a contract description through the multisig process. This test checks if the action is correctly proposed, approved, and executed, verifying the addition of the contract description.

### Updating Contract Description via Multisig

- **`test_updateContractDescription`**: After adding a description, this test proposes and approves an action to update the contract description. It ensures the update process works as intended, with the description being updated after the required approvals.

### Removing Contract Description via Multisig

- **`test_removeContractDescription`**: Tests the process of proposing and approving an action to remove a contract description. It verifies that the description is removed after the action receives the necessary approvals.

## Revert Scenarios

### Executing Invalid Action

- **`test_executeInvalidAction`**: Attempts to execute an action that should fail (e.g., removing a non-existent contract description). This test checks that the system correctly reverts the action and handles errors as expected.

## Helper Functions

- **`proposeAction`**: A utility function used within tests to propose actions for adding, updating, or removing contract descriptions. It abstracts away the common logic for these operations.
- **`encodeAdd`**, **`encodeUpdate`**, **`encodeRemove`**: Functions to encode the parameters for contract description management actions, facilitating the proposal of these actions through the `MultisigContract`.
