### Solidity Smart Contract Challenge for Contract Management

Objective: Develop and test a Solidity smart contract that efficiently manages the
storage, updating, and removal of contract addresses and their corresponding
descriptions.

### Task Details:

Contract Creation:

- Design a smart contract named ContractManager.
- The contract should enable storage of multiple contract addresses. Each
  address should be associated with a textual description (string).
- Implement functionality to add new contract addresses with their
  descriptions.
  Update Functionality:
- Create a function to update the description of an existing contract
  address.
- Ensure that only existing contract addresses can have their descriptions
  updated.

Removal Capability:

- Implement a function to remove an existing contract address and its
  description.
- Ensure that removal is handled efficiently, without leaving gaps or unused
  data in storage.

Access Control:

- Add appropriate access control to ensure only authorized users can add,
  update, or remove contract addresses.

Testing the Contract:

- Write comprehensive tests for your smart contract.
- Ensure all functionalities (add, update, remove) are tested.
- Include tests for edge cases and access control.

Documentation:

- Document your contract functions and testing approach.
- Explain your choice of data structures and access control mechanisms.

Submission Guidelines:

- Provide the Solidity source code for ContractManager in a private github
  repository and give access to github accounts: “blockteamdeveloper”, “machieke”

- Include a separate file with your test cases and their explanations.
- Submit a document detailing your design decisions and any assumptions made.
- Submit the code via pushing on your github and share the link via email to:
  applicant-test-submission-dl@singularitydao.ai
  Evaluation Criteria:
- Correctness and efficiency of the smart contract code.
- Coverage and thoroughness of tests.
- Clarity and comprehensiveness of documentation.
- Adherence to Solidity best practices and coding standards.
