# Medium Issues

## M-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

- Found in src/ContractManager.sol [Line: 10](src/ContractManager.sol#L10)

	```solidity
	contract ContractManager is AccessControl {
	```

- Found in src/ContractManager.sol [Line: 60](src/ContractManager.sol#L60)

	```solidity
	    ) external onlyRole(UPDATE_ROLE) {
	```

- Found in src/ContractManager.sol [Line: 83](src/ContractManager.sol#L83)

	```solidity
	    ) external onlyRole(ADD_ROLE) {
	```

- Found in src/ContractManager.sol [Line: 92](src/ContractManager.sol#L92)

	```solidity
	    ) external onlyRole(REMOVE_ROLE) {
	```



# Low Issues

## L-1: Deprecated OpenZeppelin functions should not be used

Openzeppelin has deprecated several functions and replaced with newer versions. Please consult https://docs.openzeppelin.com/

- Found in src/ContractManager.sol [Line: 46](src/ContractManager.sol#L46)

	```solidity
	        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
	```



## L-2: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

- Found in src/ContractManager.sol [Line: 2](src/ContractManager.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity 0.8.20;
	```
